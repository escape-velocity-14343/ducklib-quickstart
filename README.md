## NOTICE

This repository is a modified version of Dairy-Foundation/Templates/tree/teamcode-kotlin.
It adjusts [settings.gradle.kts](settings.gradle.kts) and [build.gradle.kts](build.gradle.kts)
to be set up for ducklib usage,
and includes a simple mecanum drivetrain opmode.
Maybe don't use this,
unless you want to use ducklib.
